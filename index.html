          <span class="bold">Well, hello there. I make products better. For everyone.</span>
        </p>
        <p>I focus on the end user. What do they value? What do they want? How do they interact with the product? I rely on extensive research to inform my recommendations for product design to create an improved product that is intuitive, useful, and useable.</p>
        <p>
          I am different. Days after college graduation, I was like a new born baby kicking and screaming and wondering who on earth just pushed me into a world of unknowns. So, I went back to school and stayed there for the next eight years. Fortunately, I learned so much that my friends call me "Davipedia" and I was given the title "Dr." 
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold"> I go beyond the basics. </span></p>
        <p>
          My PhD in psychology provides me with insight others cannot provide. I take a wholeistic approach to UX design to make carefully infomred ecisions that draw on all aspects of psychology and on all knoweldge of technology. I find joy in synthesizing information to come up with solutions. I have a freakish memory. 
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">And you need me to make your product better.</span></p>

         I enjoy road cycling, running, backpacking, listening to music, learning, traveling, eating delicious food, modern design, and drinking delicious black tea.
