        <h2>Professional</h2>
        <p>
          I am a classically trained experimental psychologist in cognitive neuroscience and currently I am an applied user experience researcher for Intel. Most recently, my professional career is aimed at advancing techniques to understand and improve user experiences, efficiency, and performance.

        <p>
          I began my graduate education as a NASA Space Grant recipient focusing on cognitive psychology and gerontology with a master's thesis investigating the age-related differences in attention shifting. My PhD work in cognitive neuroscience centered on developing novel metrics of cognitive control using eye-movements. Specifically, I applied visual perception techniques to evaluate the dynamics between attention and environment using eye-movements and multi-level statistical modeling. My university teaching portfolio includes a variety of university courses in psychology: behavioral research methods, introductory cognitive psychology, and sensation & perception.
