		<div class="overview">
			<h3 class="cv-headline">Overview</h3>
			<p>I am a classically trained experimental psychologist in cognitive neuroscience and currently an applied user experience researcher. Most recently, my professional career is aimed at applying the latest in cognitive neuroscience to transportation and brain-computer interface (BCI).  Along these lines I quantitative methods such as biosensing/neuroimaging, eye tracking, and surveys but also qualitative methods of interview and heuristic evaluation.  I began my graduate education as a NASA Space Grant recipient, focusing on cognitive psychology and gerontology with a master’s thesis investigating the age-related differences in attention shifting. My doctoral work in cognitive neuroscience centered on advancing metrics of cognitive control using eye-movements. Specifically, I applied visual perception techniques to evaluate the dynamics between attention and environment using eye-movements and multi-level statistical modeling. My university teaching portfolio includes university courses in psychology: behavioral research methods, introductory cognitive psychology, and sensation & perception.

			<h3 class="cv-headline">Research Interests</h3>
			<p>
				My research interests are in user experience research, human factors engineering, and cognitive neuroscience psychology.  In particular, I am interested in applying the latest in psychological science and neuroscience to (1) improve and create new interfaces and devices, (2) improve user experience research methodologies, (3) extend the human performance through technology, and (4) understanding the dynamics of attentional control and environment in humans.
